# 3. Einstein's theory of special relativity If two bodies are moving in the same direction, where the speed of the first body with
# respect to the observer is u and the speed of the second body with respect to the first body is v, then according to the special theory
# of relativity, the speed of the first body with respect to the observer is calculated from the formula
#
# u+v1+uâ‹…vc2,
#
# where c is the speed of light (299792.458 km/s). This expression is called the sum of speeds u and v.
#
# Create a function called einsum, whose parameters are speeds u and v, and which returns the sum of these speeds according to the
# special theory of relativity.
#
# >>> u = 100000
# >>> v = 200000
# >>> einsum(u, v)
# 245392.74884785622
#
# Use this function to calculate the sum of speeds of four bodies that move in the same direction. The program should prompt for four
# speeds and print out their sum.
#
# Enter speed of the first body with respect to the observer: 100000
# Enter speed of the second body with respect to the first: 150000
# Enter speed of the third body with respect to the second: 200000
# Enter speed of the fourth body with respect to the third: 250000
# Sum of speeds is 297993.41836837644 km/s
#
# Hint. Add first two speeds. Then add the third speed to the sum. Then add the fourth speed to the sum.
